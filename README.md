This Python program provides a simple tool for encrypting and decrypting images using basic pixel manipulation. The encryption process involves applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel value, and the decryption process reverses this operation.

## Features

- Encrypt images by modifying pixel values.
- Decrypt images that were encrypted using this tool.
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.
